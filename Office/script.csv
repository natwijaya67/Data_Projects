OK, let's go have some fun.",Michael,False
17331,4,1,47,Alright.,Jim,False

And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.",Michael,False

31441,6,3,8,Right.,Jim,False
31442,6,3,8,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",Michael,False
31443,6,3,8,"Yes, I agree.",Jim,False

31517,6,3,16,"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.",Michael,False
31518,6,3,16,Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.,Jim,False
31519,6,3,16,"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",Michael,False
31520,6,3,16,It's hard to tell so far.,Jim,False
31521,6,3,16,You use your brain too much.,Michael,False

32322,6,5,11,"No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.",Oscar,False
32323,6,5,11,No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.',Dwight,False

# Exploratory Data Analysis of Google App Store
+
+ In this project, I aim to apply my new Python data analysis skills onto a real dataset. There are many factor which determine the sucess of an app, 
+ whether determined by number of installs or ratings. I have attempted to answer these questions and analyzed more than 10,000 apps.
+
+ I first started by cleaning and understanding the structure of the dataset. I understand the distribution of each key variable and determined their skewness.
+ I then performed exploratory data analysis to uncover key patterns and trends.
+
+ Feel free to give me feedback on my work, so that I may be able to improve my skills.
